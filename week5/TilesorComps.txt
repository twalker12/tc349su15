I spent a lot of time working on the style tiles. I didn't think that it would take me
as long as it did. I had never worked with style tiles before so it took me a
while to understand exactly what I wanted to do. For my first style tile I
wasn't sure which direction I wanted to go in. Once I started my second style
tile I had a better understanding of my design. Overall I think I liked using
style tiles over full comps because it saves time in the end. Having style tiles
allowed me to envision my design before actually completing the final comp.
